# JAC & Plugin

## JAC 
- Utility jobs (DSL) ----------------------> utility jobs repo
- Docker files
- Configuration
  - Scripts ----------------------> plugin
  - Properties

## Arch. challenges:
- Scripts execution order
  - requires some kind of dependency management
- How do we handle situation when there is conf. file but no plugin installed?
  - If in docker then it is better to handle plugins installation during image build
  - If not in docker then there is no other good way to handle that and we should give a hand to user
    - Provide possibility to configure such behavior where plugins are installed automatically when conf. file exists

## UX features
- Hot reload/reconfigure without restart
  - Manage Jenkins:
    - Reconfigure
    - API endpoint
    - Pipeline function
- To have a way to generate conf. file from existing Jenkins
  - Similar to what we do with slaves today

## MVP
- Global config
- JobDSL 
  - Create a seed job
- Credentials
- Clean log
- Documentation
- Travis CI
- JitPack
